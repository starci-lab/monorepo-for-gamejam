# CiFarm - Farm-to-Earn Game on Telegram
CiFarm is a Farm-To-Earn game built on the Telegram platform, taking advantage of blockchain technology for unique and engaging gameplay. Initially launching on the TON Telegram blockchain, CiFarm also aims to expand to Polkadot with NFT integration through the Unique Network.

- Farm: Grow crops and manage resources to build your farm.
- Help: Support friends or allies in managing their farms.
- Visit and Steal: Engage with the community by visiting other farmsâ€”and even attempting to "borrow" resources from your neighbors!
- With simple, appealing gameplay and direct user incentives planned for the Polkadot mainnet launch, CiFarm is designed to make blockchain gaming accessible, fun, and rewarding on Telegram.

# Key Features
